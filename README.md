# Rotten-Tomatoes-Movie-Analysis
This project aims to analyze Rotten Tomatoes movie data and critic reviews to derive insightful findings using various data analysis and visualization techniques. The project starts with data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel, followed by advanced analysis using Python, SQL, and R. The results are then visualized in Power BI to provide an interactive dashboard.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning in Excel: Organize and clean the datasets by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistent formatting.
Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Use Python to perform initial data analysis, including data visualization and basic statistics. Libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn will be utilized.
SQL Analysis: Query the datasets to extract specific insights, such as the most popular genres, top critics, and movies with the highest ratings.
Advanced Statistical Analysis (R): Apply R to perform more complex analyses such as sentiment analysis on critic reviews and clustering of movies based on ratings and reviews.
Data Visualization (Power BI): Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to display key insights, including trends in movie ratings, audience reviews, and movie performance.
By the end of the project, users will have a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between movie ratings, critic reviews, and movie genres, all presented in a user-friendly visual format.
